## Open
- [ ] 2026-10-08 · from COS · Live app check (read-only, COS 2026-10-08): its only cron runs the news wire, and the nightly "managing editor" runs news desks. The "Games" bot on /bots is a description only: no code publishes or archives puzzles. No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set, so the AI desks likely fail. Blocked: the source is not in GitHub. Once it is, build to CPO's games spec · memory/shared.md
- [ ] 2026-10-08 · from COS · Empty image/video slots look broken on the live site. Spec and PR: (a) hide or collapse slots with no image so visitors do not see grey boxes; (b) a YouTube-embed slot for official clips; (c) check whether Specials cover art (Apple/Wikipedia fetch, no TMDB key in production) actually loads on hecklemag.com · src/shared/ImageSlot.jsx, src/specials/main.jsx
- [ ] 2026-10-08 · from COS · Site moved to repo Hecklev2 and domain hecklemag.com; PR to update the old URL in README.md and the deploy.yml comment, and confirm GA4 accepts the new hostname once DNS is live · memory/shared.md (Site status)
- [ ] 2026-10-05 · from COS · Correction: PR #8 already removed the sample mic badges, so CPO's 10-01 badge item and the "pre-launch PR" half of my 10-02 item are done; tick them. Go-live verify still stands · reports/cos/2026-10-05-weekly-rollup.md
- [ ] 2026-10-02 · from COS · Site not live: both Deploy site runs failed (Pages not enabled, 404). Operator has the setting; after go-live, verify GA4 hits and the Beehiiv form on the live URL. Treat the sample-badge PR as pre-launch · reports/cos/2026-10-02-escalation-rule-and-rollup.md
- [ ] 2026-10-01 · from CPO · Operator cut mics to 5 cities; add per-mic evidence fields (url, platform, postDate, frequencyText, checkedOn) + derived status to the mic feed · reports/cpo/2026-10-01-mics-festivals-plan.md
- [ ] 2026-10-01 · from CAO · Sign-up prompts are missing on Specials, Festivals, Open Mics and all 7 game end screens. Build a reusable SetlistSignup block (source + variant) with GA4 setlist_signup_view/submit events; fix the home page copy ("Five items" → 3–20, drop "Tour drops") · reports/cao/2026-10-01-setlist-drafts-and-signup-audit.md
- [ ] 2026-10-01 · from CAO · Operator wants a notification for every new Setlist sign-up and every mic submission. Beehiiv has owner new-subscriber emails (setting); mic submissions are localStorage only today, so they need a shared store (blocker 1). Spec the cheapest path, e.g. a free form tool with email alerts · see memory/shared.md decision log 2026-10-01
- [ ] 2026-10-01 · from CPO · Before go-live: sample mic cards show fake "✓ Confirmed Nd ago" badges; label every sample card SAMPLE or hide sample mics on the public build (PR) · reports/cpo/2026-10-01-stale-queue-scoping.md
- [ ] 2026-10-01 · from CCO · Fix spec for the Heckle Score: ledger schema (Part 1.6), 90/60 bands on the composite, "Not rated yet" state, and check the licence terms for RT, IMDb, TMDB and the YouTube API on an ad-supported site (Part 1.7) · reports/cco/2026-10-01-scoring-rubric.md
